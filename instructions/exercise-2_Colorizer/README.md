# Exercise-2: Colorizer

Implement the [Colorizer.ts](/src/classes/Colorizer.ts) `green` and `yellow` methods.

The methods should use [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) to colorize the string and return the result. Install chalk at version `^4.1.2`. The [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) module exports its own types, so there is no need install `@types/chalk`.

The methods should accept a string as a parameter.

- For the `green` method, the string should be colored black text with a green background.
- For the `yellow` method, the string should be colored black text with a yellow background.

Check your solution with:
```sh
npm run test:2
```
